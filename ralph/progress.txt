=== RALPH WIGGUM IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS ===
Started: 2026-01-09
Current Phase: Setup & Planning
Project: Autonomous blog content generation with iterative self-improvement

---

## PHASE STATUS

[ ] Phase 0: Vertical Spike (Days 1-3)
    Goal: Prove Claude + Supabase + RSS integration works
    Success: 3 blog drafts in Supabase

[ ] Phase 1: Core Ralph Loop (Days 4-14)
    Goal: Single-agent iterative content generation
    Success: 5 published posts, 2-4 iterations avg, zero AI slop

[ ] Phase 2: Production Deployment (Days 15-21)
    Goal: Automate daily 7 AM blog generation
    Success: 5 consecutive automated days

[ ] Phase 3: Multi-Agent System (Days 22-35)
    Goal: Add TrendScout and Research agents
    Success: Relevant trends, +5-10% quality improvement

[ ] Phase 4: Monitoring & Hardening (Days 36-42)
    Goal: Production-grade observability
    Success: Tests pass, docs complete, monitoring operational

## CURRENT TASKS

[x] Create PRD structure - Phase-specific JSON with verification steps
[x] Save overall plan as RALPH_OVERALL_PLAN.md
[x] Consolidate progress tracking into single progress.txt

[ ] Complete database setup (Phase 0)
[ ] Build spike.py proof of concept
[ ] Verify 3 successful drafts in Supabase

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

- "Boring correctness" philosophy - prioritize reliability over cleverness
- Zero tolerance for AI slop (forbidden phrases list enforced)
- Quality thresholds: 0.85 to publish, 0.70 minimum for draft, <0.70 = fail
- Cost guards: $1 per generation run, 30-minute timeout
- Agents communicate via direct function calls (not database messaging)
- Supabase for all persistence (no dual-storage complexity)
- Systemd for scheduling (no Docker/containers)
- Environment variables only for secrets (never in code)
- Fail loudly, never silently (explicit error handling)

## LEARNINGS & INSIGHTS

[2026-01-09 - Setup]
- Project structure is clear with separate PRD per phase
- PRD.md should contain verification steps, not implementation steps
- Each task formatted as: category, description, steps[], passes: false
- Manufacturing industry requires technical accuracy and expertise
- MAS Precision Parts brand voice: professional, technical, helpful (not salesy)
- Database schema uses blog_* prefix for all related tables
- Multi-phase approach reduces risk: spike → core → production → multi-agent
- Progress tracking should be simple, not over-engineered

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Which 5 manufacturing RSS sources for initial seed?
2. Email provider preference (Resend.com vs SMTP)?
3. Can user provide 2-3 example blog posts for brand voice reference?
4. Monitoring preference (Grafana vs Supabase dashboard)?
5. Should we implement Phase 5 (social media) or skip?

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Begin Phase 0: Database setup in Supabase
2. Create spike.py with minimal logic
3. Test Claude + Supabase + RSS integration
4. Run 3 times, verify 3 drafts in database
5. Document learnings before Phase 1

## QUALITY SCORING GUIDE

Code Quality Score (0.0-1.0):
- Correctness: 25%
- Readability: 25%
- Boring Correctness: 20%
- Testing: 15%
- Documentation: 15%

Target: ≥ 0.85 to proceed
Floor: 0.70 (save as draft)
Fail: < 0.70 (rework required)

## NOTES

Update this file after each:
- Completed task or iteration
- Important decision or insight
- Phase completion
- Quality milestone

Keep it simple. Add dated entries chronologically.

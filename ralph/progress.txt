=== RALPH WIGGUM IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS ===
Started: 2026-01-16
Current Phase: Phase 2 - Production Deployment
Project: Autonomous blog content generation with iterative self-improvement

---

## PHASE STATUS

[x] Phase 0: Vertical Spike (Days 1-3) - COMPLETE
    Goal: Prove Claude + Supabase + RSS integration works
    Completed: 2026-01-13

[x] Phase 1: Core Ralph Loop (Days 4-14) - COMPLETE
    Goal: Single-agent iterative content generation
    Completed: 2026-01-16

[ ] Phase 2: Production Deployment (Days 15-21)
    Goal: Automate daily 7 AM UTC blog generation
    Success: 5 consecutive automated days

[ ] Phase 3: Multi-Agent System (Days 22-35)
    Goal: Add TrendScout and Research agents
    Success: Relevant trends, +5-10% quality improvement

[ ] Phase 4: Monitoring & Hardening (Days 36-42)
    Goal: Production-grade observability
    Success: Tests pass, docs complete, monitoring operational

## CURRENT TASKS

[ ] sys-001: Configure systemd service for ralph_loop
[ ] sys-002: Configure systemd timer for daily 7 AM UTC execution
[ ] alert-001: Set up email alerts on failure
[ ] mon-001: Create monitoring dashboard
[ ] val-001: Validate 5 consecutive automated days

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

- "Boring correctness" philosophy - prioritize reliability over cleverness
- Zero tolerance for AI slop (forbidden phrases list enforced)
- Quality thresholds: 0.85 to publish, 0.70 minimum for draft, <0.70 = fail
- Cost guards: $1 per generation run, 30-minute timeout
- Agents communicate via direct function calls (not database messaging)
- Supabase for all persistence (no dual-storage complexity)
- Systemd for scheduling (no Docker/containers)
- Environment variables only for secrets (never in code)
- Fail loudly, never silently (explicit error handling)

## LEARNINGS & INSIGHTS

[2026-01-16 - Phase 2 Start]
- Phase 1 completed successfully with all exit criteria met
- System generates quality content with 2-3 iterations average
- Cost per post: ~$0.18-0.32 (well under $0.50 budget)
- Ready for production deployment automation

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Email provider preference (Resend.com vs SMTP)?
2. Monitoring preference (Grafana vs Supabase dashboard)?
3. Alert thresholds for monitoring (cost spikes, failure rates)?

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Create systemd service file for ralph_loop
2. Create systemd timer for 7 AM UTC daily execution
3. Configure email alerts for failures
4. Set up basic monitoring dashboard
5. Run 5 consecutive automated days to validate

## QUALITY SCORING GUIDE

Code Quality Score (0.0-1.0):
- Correctness: 25%
- Readability: 25%
- Boring Correctness: 20%
- Testing: 15%
- Documentation: 15%

Target: >= 0.85 to proceed
Floor: 0.70 (save as draft)
Fail: < 0.70 (rework required)
